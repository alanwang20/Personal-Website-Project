		<h1> About me: </h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my website!<br><br>
				
				I&#39;m Alan, an upcoming fourth year business student at the University of Georgia pursuing a double major in Management Information Systems and Economics. With interests in Data Science/Analytics, Data Engineering, and Technical Project Management/Ownership, I'm applying to Masters programs in Analytics and Statistics this upcoming cycle to further my education upon graduation.<br><br>
	
				Recently, I was a Data Engineer/Technical Product Owner Intern for Centene Corporation, where I was able to turn my passion for data into tangible products and data pipelines. My time spent there has exposed me to how data is analyzed and engineered on a day-to-day basis, with most of my work consisting of Snowflake, PowerBI, Python, and Excel, as well as organizational applications such as Jira, Microsoft Suite, Visio, and Miro. <br><br>
				
				Outside of my studies, I enjoy developing my leadership, interpersonal communication, and DEI skills on campus through heavy involvement in UGA&#39;s Greek and Student Organizations, hoping to not only enrich my college experience, but to also enrich the experience of others. Having just completed my 2022-2023 term as Chapter President of my fraternity, I now delegate the majority of this time as the Director of Recruitment and Programming for Order of Omega, a teaching assistant for MIST 2090, as well as a mentor for the Asian American Student Association.<br><br> 
				
				However, when I&#39;m not busy worrying about academics or extracurriculars, you can find me winding down the day by playing guitar or piano, playing golf, or singing at the top of my lungs in the shower.
